            <p>
                The Copyright Protection Project is an international initiative
                launched by MGC (Minecraft Graphics Community) to address
                Minecraft UGC infringement and plagiarism in China. Our goal is
                to preserve UGC creators' rights and creations, while promoting
                the growth and development of the community, and protecting the
                community's spontaneous derivation and development behavior. We
                want to show international authors that you are doing an amazing
                thing and are respected in China by a group of Minecraft
                enthusiasts who are very well intentioned.

                <p>
                    The platform provides UGC creators with professional graphic
                    copyright protection services, rights defense actions on
                    behalf of creators through agency agreements, and feedback
                    on results and compensation distribution. The platform is an
                    independent, open, and compassionate pioneering project that
                    aims to protect UGC (especially UGC in graphic) in
                    Minecraft.

                        Signing with an author will give MGC the ability to have
                        full legal recourse against post-signing, as well as the
                        ability to retroactively assist with rights prior to
                        signing. Through legal appeals, we are able to rectify
                        the environment and combat infringement from the
                        outside.

                        China has a huge number of Minecraft players and loves
                        Minecraft graphics. A big part of their support for
                        piracy behavior is that it's too difficult to obtain a
                        legitimate copy, in terms of ability and access. We can
                        better capitalize on the Chinese market by distributing
                        your work on our own platform

                        NetEase and Afdian(means Aficionado), and the ease of
                        access makes players more inclined to get officially
                        sourced work. This promotes a positive environment from
                        within.

                    endeavor, only to have someone else steal your work, pass it
                    off as their own, and reap immense financial rewards. Now,
                    picture that person using those ill-gotten gains to purchase
                    a luxury item like a Model X. He show off on the media, then
                    you could do nothing? What recourse do you have? Where is
                    justice?

                    We are launching a public welfare project with the mission
                    of protecting the rights of creators and fostering a
                    thriving creative community. We envision a platform that
                    empowers creators through tangible benefits, attracting more
                    individuals to join our ranks and inspiring existing
                    creators to produce even more exceptional work. At the very
                    least, we want to ensure that in times of crisis, creators
                    have a financial safety net to fall back on, preventing them
                    from facing ridicule and condemnation for dedicating their
                    time and energy to pursuits that may not yield immediate
                    monetary rewards. This is the true essence of love and
                    support.

                    In China, countless individuals have fallen victim to this
                    injustice. Their unwavering passion for projects like
                    Minecraft has led them to financial ruin, starvation, and
                    even death. They endure disapproval and moral judgment from
                    those around them, but are powerless to defend their stolen
                    works. This cannot continue.

                    We are young, and we have the power to reshape societal
                    norms and fight against these injustices. Within the
                    confines of Chinese law, we will relentlessly pursue both
                    anonymous and known perpetrators of plagiarism and copyright
                    infringement.

                        In the realm of creativity, where passion meets
                        innovation, a dark shadow looms. Plagiarism and
                        copyright infringement, like insidious parasites, prey
                        on the works of dedicated creators, stealing their
                        blood, sweat, and tears, and transforming them into
                        ill-gotten gains.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We, a collective of impassioned individuals, refuse to
                        stand idly by while this injustice persists. We stand
                        united, our voices echoing a clarion call to protect
                        creators and uphold the sanctity of creative expression.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our mission is twofold: to eradicate these
                        transgressions from Chinese soil and to restore stolen
                        rewards to their rightful owners.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First, we must combat the rampant piracy that plagues
                        China's creative landscape. These acts, though confined
                        within national borders, have far-reaching implications.
                        They undermine the very foundation of global creativity,
                        siphoning off the lifeblood of creators worldwide. We
                        cannot turn a blind eye to this moral injustice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our second objective is to ensure that the fruits of
                        creators' labor are rightfully returned to them. To
                        create is to love, and users should never take the
                        privilege of accessing and enjoying these creations for
                        granted. Creators deserve support, whether in the form
                        of financial compensation or unwavering protection of
                        their intellectual property.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To international creators, we extend a message of
                        solidarity and admiration. Your work is not in vain. In
                        China, you have a fervent community of Minecraft
                        enthusiasts who deeply appreciate your contributions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our proposed solution is groundbreaking, both within
                        China and on a global scale. By establishing a unified
                        platform, we empower creators to protect their work and
                        monetize it responsibly in China, all while adhering to
                        the EULA guidelines set forth by Mojang. This initiative
                        is a beacon of hope, a testament to our unwavering
                        commitment to safeguarding creative integrity.

                        us all. Join us in this noble endeavor, and together, we
