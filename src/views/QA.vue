                <h3>Q: Chinese people and companys are unreliable.</h3>
                <p>True dude! Some are shit indeed. But when it comes to law and financial, it is guranteed by the
                    global.
                    We want to build trust with you in an independent role and capacity.</p>
                <p>
                    All the articles can be double-checked until you think they are reasonable. We have designed a
                    generous "honeymoon" period to help us through the trust crisis.We offer a variety of agreements for
                    depth of cooperation. Which one you choose is entirely up to you, with your own interests in mind.
                    Your interests. These agreements are recognized by other authors who have already signed them, while
                    our version of the agreement is constantly being revised in response to suggestions. The agreements
                    are valid in both English and Chinese.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have been in a low-income partnership for a very long time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During cooperation, we actively synchronize our messages, and we synchronize our messages with a
                    frequency that can even annoy you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, if anything, if we were to profit illegally, we honestly wouldn't even have to go to the
                    trouble of asking for your permission, just like the infringers.
                </p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Q: Why do you need an agency license? Why MGC?</h3>
                <p>The status quo is that infringers are mostly individuals, dispersed in various places, and infringing
                    on multiple authors at the same time. If the authors act independently, it will result in a
                    many-to-many, multi-location, long-duration wheel war, with small penalties, small stopping scope,
                    and no way to prevent the infringer from changing the target of infringement at no cost, which is
                    very unfavorable to the authors. </p>
                <p>But once the agency agreement is signed, the MGC logically becomes
                    a victim of interest in the infringement, and the MGC will be given the legal right to appeal and
                    the obligation to provide legal assistance as agreed in the agreement. Regardless of the time and
                    geographic span, the situation at this point will become several one-on-one, and can be resolved
                    thoroughly one by one. It's a joint venture, and the MGC is the agent.</p>

                <h3>Q: What are your plans to address copyright infringement and plagiarism of graphic works both in
                    China and internationally?</h3>
                <p>We are committed to protecting the rights and interests of authors globally. In China, we are
                    currently focused on protecting copyrighted works from international authors. We have researched the
                    laws and internet environments of various countries and believe that this is feasible in China. As
                    for the international community, we have not yet figured out a solution, and may need to establish
                    branches, but that is for the future.</p>
                <p>
                    If the environment in China improves, we will collaborate with UGC authors around the world to set
                    up a branch to promote global MC UGC content protection. We want to stop the continuation of these
                    types of incidents in China, both on open web platforms and on NetEase, and to penalize these
                    actions. While these actions may not be directly relevant to the international market, they should
                    be morally relevant to the international market as we believe that these actions infringe on the
                    rights and interests of authors globally while generating multi-million dollar windfalls from them.
                    We are waiting for international UGC authors to cooperate with us and then deal a heavy blow to the
                    infringers.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Q: How do you legally characterise MC UGC content??</h3>
                <p>We consider MCUCG as digital art, algorithmic art, installation art, digital assets, etc. This is
                    because MCUGC can be considered as independent works under the EULA and not related to Mojang and
                    NetEase. At this point, these files can be protected independently.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Q: What laws will you use? Where will you enforce the rights?</h3>
                <p>We will utilize Chinese copyright law to defend our rights to Minecraft UGC content globally in
                    China. We have retained professional legal counsel and attorneys to provide legal advice and
                    assistance, and will maintain communication and cooperation with the original authors to seek a more
                    complete scope of protection and maximum compensation.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Q: What's the situation in China</h3>
                <p>The main ringleaders have accumulated millions of dollars. We've been laying the groundwork for years
                    to cut down this behavior, and we're just missing the approval and cooperation of the infringed
                    authors.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Q: How do you promote the growth and development of your community? What incentives do you offer
                    creators?</h3>
                <p>Since the Minecraft in China is distributed by NetEase, Mojang does not interfere with the Chinese
                    market, and China does not restrict the community's secondary derivative development, in this
                    context, it is not a violation of the EULA agreement for authors to realise a small amount of the
                    material packs they make. We can create a platform that encourages the growth and development of the
                    community with tangible benefits, attracts more creators, and allows existing creators to make
                    better and more amazing work.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Q: Where would this fund even come from?</h3>
                <p>The project is funded by several of the most infringed Chinese writers, or rather, the MGC itself.
                    They want to get justice and deal a heavy blow to the pirates. It also comes from the personal
                    support of MGC members. Over the years, we have saved enough money.</p>

                <h3>Q: I could't.</h3>
                <p>"Then we could do nothing" is an outdated idea.
                    We found a way to bring infringers to justice.
                    In the future, the original authors will be better known and more respected than the pirates, and
                    the players will honor the original by celebrating your name in the game instead of your imposters:
                    "Minecraft Tom", "MC Jack", "MC Tiktok Nancy".</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Q: I don't care.</h3>
                <p>The infringer profits from the sale of your work and you get less income, if not a penny. Think back
                    to all those times when you were in dire straits because you didn't have enough money to pay for
                    some of your creativity and ideas. That money could have been used to support you in creating more
                    great work or to improve your living conditions.</p>
                <p>And when people see your work being pirated and sold, they may mistakenly think that you tacitly
                    approve of this behavior, which can lead to a larger scale of infringement.</p>
                <p>
                    Authors Seeing their work being pirated at will, many feel disheartened and lose motivation to
                    create. Also along with mojang updates, this led to a gradual decrease in quality content in the
                    Minecraft community, and poor quality content began to proliferate. As a result, the world's largest
                    game creation community, the Minecraft community, has been hurt.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course, there's no condemnation for leaving it alone, because it's your own work.

                <h3>Q: What do I need to do?</h3>

                <p>- Signing any of the agreements is recommended</p>
                <p>- Proof of willingness to appeal, subject to approval, varies for each author in terms of how many
                    and to whom they are required.</p>
                <p> - Preserve evidence of the creative process: e.g. time of creation, drafts, versions of documents,
                    etc.</p>

                <h3>Q: Now I don't want to</h3>
                <p>Silence and condoning infringement will result in the difficulty and cost of defending your rights
                    becoming progressively more difficult, the entanglement of interests, the tracing of information,
                    and the proof of authority becoming more and more complex and difficult, and more and more
                    infringers will follow suit, which will make infringement even more rampant, and ultimately,
                    seriously jeopardize the development of the community as a whole and the interests of individuals.
                </p>
                <p>Predictably, this will take considerable time and effort, and may even be a bit tedious for you. We
                    could start small to build up trust, energy and financial resources.</p>
                <p>
                    We offer to help with everything except our willingness to appeal. We will advance all expenses,
                    even your car and travel expenses.
